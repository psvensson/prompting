Create a program using the following instructions. Follow them very closely:

general requirements:
    all program code must be written in common lisp.
    do not create python scripts
    do not use any version control.
    do not use git.
    do not generate any images or pictures.  
    do not use any editors. You are also an editor, able to read, modify and write files directly.
    all files must be written to the local filesystem immediately when created or changed.
    do not install any additional software.

coding requirements:        
    write short and sweet functions and classes.
    comment to explain what is being done.
    do not write any tests.
    make sure to create a unique package for the code
    do not analyze code.
    do not execute programs.
 
steps:
    read the description of the program to create in the file program.txt
    break up the coding into a series of detailed steps (not just a placeholder!), which you can generate a common lisp program from.
    write the steps into a local file named coding-steps.txt.
    follow the steps in order to create the program.
